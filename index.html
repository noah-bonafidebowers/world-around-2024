				On the surface, my family and upbringing may seem typical. Ordinary house, financially okay, and divorced parents, but that’s common for America. On the inside, however, I have faced tremendous emotional turmoil and familial conflict made growing up difficult for me. Because of those things, I turned to personal comforts staying in doors and grew a lack of direction, causing me to become lonely and confused to the outside world. 
			<br><br>
				That said, there is, indeed, a great, big world out there. One that I want to be a part of now, but one I didn’t see when I was growing up, which caused me to think it was not so great in my pivotal teenage years. In short, I wanted to completely abandon this world, believing that any form of society or technology is actually regressive for us because it seemed every new invention of technology or social convention seemed to have a negative side effect. Now, that may be true to an extent, every improvement has its unforseen consequences; however, it doesn’t mean that we cannot find balance in this modern world, but that is simply something I did not experience growing up, causing me to grow distaste for this world and believe it to be a dark, horrible place. That would be taking so much for granted, especially when there is so much opportunity for nearly everyone and so much beauty to see thanks to modern tech and societal structures.
				<br><br>
				I believe too many people have grown up this way and too many young people will continue to grow up this way if we do not change something. The goal of this exhibition is to encourage you to take a look around at this world and its complexity. How will we accurately inform our future generations in order to help them understand how to live in a world where there is so much? What aspects of our culture hold us back from seeing the world? What is the most important thing in our lives, and how do we balance that with everything that there is…?
